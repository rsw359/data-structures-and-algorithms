# Merge-Sort

In this challenge, we write a function that breakse a list down, then  sort it  ascending order

## Approach & Efficiency

The time complexity for Merge-Sort is (N log N), which is the most efficient search algorithm no matter how long the array or list, it will always take the same amount of time.

The space is O(1) since the size of the data does not change throughout the process.

## Solution

To run the code, clone the repo and run tests using pytest.

The code is located in *python/code_challenges/merge_sort.py*

The tests are located at *python/tests/code_challenges/test_merge_sort.py*

To run the test enter the 'pytest' command at the root of the repository, or use *pytest -k python/tests/code_challenges/test_merge_sort.py*
