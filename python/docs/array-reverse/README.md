# Reverse an Array

The challenge here is to reverse the contents of an array(or list in Python) without using any built in methods. The process needs to be explained to someone new to code.

## Approach & Efficiency

The slicing approach is taken because it provides the simplest way to reverse the values of a given array, being that we cannot use methods like array.reverse.

The Time Complexity for this algorithm grows along with the amount of data elements making it: O(N)
