# Array-Insert-Shift

The challenge here is to add a value to the middle of an array(or list in Python) without using any built in methods. The process needs to be explained to someone new to code.

## Approach & Efficiency

The concatenation approach is taken because it provides the simplest way to append the new value to the given array, being that we cannot use methods like array.insert.

## Time Complexity

The Time Complexity for this algorithm grows along with the amount of data elements making it: O(N)
