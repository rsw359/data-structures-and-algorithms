# Stacks and Queues

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue. It was also necesary to create a node class with pointers as its properties.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach included importing already existing Linked List methods and Exception handling. After that the following methods were implemented:

  1. pop
  2. push
  3. peek
  4. is empty
  5. enqueue
  6. dequeue

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for these methods was O(1).
