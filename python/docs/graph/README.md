# Graphs

A graph is a data structure in which vertices are connected to each other through connections called edges.

## Challenge

The challenge isimplement a funtion that can add vertices and edges to a graph, and get the vertices and also return the size of the graph.

## Approach & Efficiency

The Big O time complexity of get_nodes is O(1) since it uses the key for each node.
