# Hashtables
Here we will implement a hash table that implements a hash of the key of a given key value pair, and can run a number of operations using the key.

## Challenge
The challenge it to implement a hashtable that can get values, keys, and can handle collisions.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O time complexity for get operations on a  hash table is O(1)
Big O space complexity for the set function is also O(1)
