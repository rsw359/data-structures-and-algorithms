# Singly Linked List

The purpose pf this code challenge is to create a node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Challenge

The goals of this challenge are:

1. To create a Linked List class that:
    1. Includes a HEAD property
    2. Creates a new node upon instantiation
2. The class needs to contain:
    1. An Insert Method that takes in a value, returns nothing, and adds a new node containing that value as the HEAD
    2. An Includes Method that also takes in a value and returns a boolean that indicates whether the value exists in the list
    3. A To String Method that returns a string representing all the values in the List

3. The Time Performance should be O(1)
